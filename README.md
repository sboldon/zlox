# zlox

A bytecode interpreter for Lox, a dynamically typed language with classes and first-class functions,
implemented in Zig. The Lox language was created by Robert Nystrom for his book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), in which he implements a tree-walking interpreter for
the language in Java and a bytecode interpreter for the language in C.
